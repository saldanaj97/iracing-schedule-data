SCL is an online e-racing league that sanctions one of the best in console/pc based sim championship racing. Traditionally based on the Gran Turismo series, SCL transitioned to ps4 and the Project Cars 2 game in fall 2017. We have now transitioned to iRacing for our 10th Anniversary. SCL championship seasons typically run approximately 13 weeks followed by a 4-5 week offseason, which has resulted in 35 completed championship seasons since 2010. \n \n SCL is unique in that we have blended a fine combination of staying true to our roots and what we have built ourselves upon, while also having schedules that appeal to a broad population. \n \n You can check out our broadcasted series on Sim Racing Media's YouTube Channel.",
